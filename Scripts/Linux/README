The scripts in this folder can be used to create a Unturned 3 environment on various linux distros.
Before you launch your server there are a few dependencies that have to be installed. 

Right now there is only a recipe available tested on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS / Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. 
If you figure how to install Rocket on another distro or UNIX/Mac then feel free

## Recipe for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS / Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

*Utils*

apt-get install screen htop unzip                    				                        

*Mono*

apt-get install libmono2.0-cil mono-runtime          				                        

*Unity 3D requires a headless X server to run*

apt-get install Xorg xinit x11-common  

*Those libraries are required for Unity 3D to work, since i didn't figure how to host x64 servers the 32bit ones should be enought*

apt-get install libglu1-mesa libxcursor1 libxrandr2  			                    # Native 64 bit Unity 3D prerequisites	
apt-get install libc6:i386 libgl1-mesa-glx:i386 libxcursor1:i386 libxrandr2:i386    # 32 bit prerequisites for Unity 3D

## Steps to install and run a Unturned 3 server with Rocket
1. **Install the prerequisites**

2. **Start the X-Server**

screen -S XServer startx

3. **Copy the scripts "start.sh" and "update.sh" in the root of the folder you want your Unturned 3 environment in**

The scripts will by default create a new hierarchy that looks like this:
    ~/
      unturned/
      steamcmd/

4. **Run the update script to install Unturned 3**

chmod 755 update.sh && ./update.sh <steam username> <steam password>
*Note: To make sure Steam Guard is not bugging you better create a new Steam account and disable Steam Guard*

5. **Install Rocket**

Download the latest Rocket for Linux and place all assemblies (*.dll) into  ~/unturned/Unturned_Data/Managed/ and the RocketLauncher.exe into ~/unturned/ so that the new hierarchy looks like this:
    ~/
      unturned/
                ...
                RocketLauncher.exe
                Unturned_Data/
                              ...
                              Managed/
                                      ...
                                      Assembly-CSharp.dll
                                      Rocket.API.dll
                                      Rocket.Core.dll
                                      Rocket.Unturned.dll
      steamcmd/

6. **Create a screen and start the server, pick any single word as unique instance name**

screen -S <instance name>
chmod 755 start.sh && ./start.sh <instance name>
