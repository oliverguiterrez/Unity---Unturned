The scripts in this folder can be used to create a Unturned 3 environment on various linux distros.
Before you launch your server there are a few dependencies that have to be installed. 

Right now there is only a recipe available tested on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS / Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. 
If you figure how to install Rocket on another distro or UNIX/Mac then feel free
to extend this file at https://github.com/RocketMod/Rocket.Unturned/new/master/Scripts/Linux/README


# Recipe for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS / Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

apt-get install screen htop unzip                    				                        # Utils
apt-get install libmono2.0-cil mono-runtime          				                        # Mono   

apt-get install Xorg xinit x11-common                			                          # Headless X server

apt-get install libglu1-mesa libxcursor1 libxrandr2  			                          # Native 64 bit Unity 3D prerequisites	
apt-get install libc6:i386 libgl1-mesa-glx:i386 libxcursor1:i386 libxrandr2:i386    # 32 bit prerequisites for Unity 3D


#Unity 3D requires a xserver to run, start it with:
#screen -S XServer startx


# Note: To make sure Steam Guard is not bugging you better create a new Steam account and disable Steam Guard

#Unity 3D requires a xserver to run, open it with startx in another screen
