The scripts in this folder can be used to create a Unturned 3 environment on various linux distros.
Before you launch your server there are a few dependencies that have to be installed. 

Right now there is only a recipe available tested on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS / Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. 
If you figure how to install Rocket on another distro or UNIX/Mac then feel free
to extend this file at https://github.com/RocketMod/Rocket.Unturned/new/master/Scripts/Linux/README

## Recipe for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS / Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
apt install screen htop unzip #Utils
dpkg --add-architecture i386
apt install lib32stdc++6 #SteamCMD dependencies
apt install mono-runtime libmono2.0-cil
apt install libc6:i386 libgl1-mesa-glx:i386 libxcursor1:i386 libxrandr2:i386 # 32 bit prerequisites for Unity 3D
apt install libc6-dev-i386 libgcc-4.8-dev:i386 # prequesites for BattlEye

##Recipe for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
apt install screen htop unzip #Utils
dpkg --add-architecture i386
apt install lib32stdc++6 #SteamCMD dependencies
apt install mono-runtime mono-reference-assemblies-2.0		                        
apt install libc6:i386 libgl1-mesa-glx:i386 libxcursor1:i386 libxrandr2:i386 # 32 bit prerequisites for Unity 3D
apt install libc6-dev-i386 libgcc-4.8-dev:i386 # prequesites for BattlEye

## Steps to install

1. Install the prerequisites (Shown in the recipe above)
2. Copy the contents of the linux download in the root of the folder you want your Unturned 3 environment in
    cd ~
    wget http://api.rocketmod.net/download/unturned-linux/latest/YOURAPIKEY/rocket.zip -O rocket.zip
    unzip -o rocket.zip
    rm rocket.zip
3. Fix permissions and run the update script to install Unturned 3
    cd ~/Scripts
    chmod 755 update.sh
    chmod 755 start.sh
    ./update.sh <steam username> <steam password>
    
    The scripts will create a hierarhy like this:
         ~/
            Scripts/
            Steam/
            unturned/
            steamcmd/
            
    #Note: To make sure Steam Guard is not bugging you better create a new Steam account and disable Steam Guard
    
4. Start the server, pick any single word as unique instance name
    screen -S <instance name>
    cd ~/Scripts
    ./start.sh <instance name>

5. To update Unturned & Rocket simply exit the server and the screen and start from step 2

## Issues on Linux, and how to solve them
1.
Symptoms:
	My server crashes frequently or not so frequently during startup, runtime or shutdown. 
	The console becomes unresponsive and output freezes completely but it does forward console input to the server instance. 
	After being unresponsive for an unknown time period the server finally crashes with a SIGSEGV exception.
Solution: 
	Downgrade from Mono v4.x.x to Mono v3.12.1
System:
	Ubuntu 16.04, 64-bit
