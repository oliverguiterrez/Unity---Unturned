The scripts in this folder can be used to create a Unturned 3 environment on various linux distros.
Before you launch your server there are a few dependencies that have to be installed. 

Right now there is only a recipe available tested on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS / Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. 
If you figure how to install Rocket on another distro or UNIX/Mac then feel free
to extend this file at https://github.com/RocketMod/Rocket.Unturned/new/master/Scripts/Linux/README


## Recipe for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS / Ubuntu 14.04 LTS / Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

#Utils
apt-get install screen htop unzip

#SteamCMD dependencies
apt-get install lib32stdc++6

#Mono
apt-get install libmono2.0-cil mono-runtime# On Ubuntu 16.04 LTS the package libmono2.0-cil has been renamed to mono-reference-assemblies-2.0		                        

#Those libraries are required for Unity 3D to work, since i didn't figure how to host x64 servers the 32bit ones should be enought
apt-get install libglu1-mesa libxcursor1 libxrandr2 # Native 64 bit Unity 3D prerequisites	
apt-get install libc6:i386 libgl1-mesa-glx:i386 libxcursor1:i386 libxrandr2:i386 # 32 bit prerequisites for Unity 3D

## Steps to install

1. Install the prerequisites (Shown in the recipe above)
2. Copy the scripts "start.sh" and "update.sh" in the root of the folder you want your Unturned 3 environment in
    The scripts will by default create a new hierarchy that looks like this:
         ~/
            unturned/
            steamcmd/
3. Fix permissions and run the update script to install Unturned 3
    chmod 755 update.sh
    chmod 755 start.sh
    ./update.sh <steam username> <steam password>
    #Note: To make sure Steam Guard is not bugging you better create a new Steam account and disable Steam Guard
4. Install Rocket
    Download the latest Rocket for Linux and place all assemblies (*.dll) into  ~/unturned/Unturned_Headless_Data/Managed/ and the RocketLauncher.exe into ~/unturned/ so that the new hierarchy looks like this:
        ~/
            unturned/
                    ...
                    RocketLauncher.exe
                    Unturned_Headless_Data/
                                ...
                                 Managed/
                                        ...
                                        Assembly-CSharp.dll
                                        Rocket.API.dll
                                        Rocket.Core.dll
                                        Rocket.Unturned.dll
            steamcmd/

## Steps to start
1. Start Steam if not already running 
    screen -S Steam steam
2. Start the server, pick any single word as unique instance name
    screen -S <instance name>
    ./start.sh <instance name>
